ls: infidelity (not quite consistent for the first files)
l1s: integrated leakage
l2s: gradient wrt. phi

m0: no robustness input.
mx: m = 1e-x/pi

It seems that when straightforwardly adding the time-averaged leakage it doesn't find a true robust minimum.
However it seems to achieve a lower final infidelity than for m0.

mm: both grad and integrated leakage receive m-factor.
mm20: m = 1e-2/pi and l1sscale = 0 ie, no integrated leakage term.
mmxx_1: The new parametrization, where the amplitude is not A/(Delta t) but just A.


Which use p0 = 2.0, 10.0, 10.0,  0.7,  0.0,  2.5,  0.1,  0.995pi,  0.0
m3_1, mm30_1, mm33_1, mm30, mm33, mm20 (uden tmp_..)
